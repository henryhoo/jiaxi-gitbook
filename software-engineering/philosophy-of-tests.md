# Philosophy of tests

### What makes a good test

* Run fast
* Reproduce locally
* Don't break often, not flaky
* Easy to read/understand
* Catch actual bugs
* Survive big refactoring 

### Best practices 

* Add test to catch it in the future after fixing bug
* Share your effective testing strategy to the team
  * Strategy are different in different per project
  * Good strategy take iterations to be found 

### Things to avoid

* Mocking too much reduce test quality
* Too much isolation make test not catching actual bugs \(e.g. in integration level\)
