# WHAC 3 minutes pitch rule

The WHAC method is a key component of the Three Minute Rule, and essentially forms the outline and the key structure of a great pitch.

The WHAC method is about organizing your information so that your audience processes it in the right order and receives all the information you want them to have to make their decision. The order in which you give the information is absolutely essential.

**W \(What is it?\):** Quickly tell someone what it is that you do, or what it is that you are offering.   
  
**H \(How does it work?\):** Explain how your idea works. Give a rundown on exactly how your idea will function so that they understand exactly what you are trying to pitch to them 

**A \(Are you sure?\):** After youâ€™ve explained your idea, give them reasons to back up what you said, and reasons why they should believe your claims. Explain why what you do is/will be effective. If there is research to back it up, you can mention it here. They already know what it is you do and how it works; now you convince them why they should believe you. 

**C \(Can you do it?\):** This is all about whether your idea will actually be practical to put into action. This is where you use your past knowledge, your available resources and skills, and financial feasibility to prove that you can do this. You need to prove that your pitch is realistic and attainable. This is essentially the logistics phase of the pitch.
